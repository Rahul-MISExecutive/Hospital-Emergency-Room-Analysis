# Hospital Emergency Room Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital emergency room (ER) data to derive actionable insights into patient flow, wait times, satisfaction, and other key operational metrics. The goal is to identify trends, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement within the hospital's emergency department, potentially leading to better patient care and operational efficiency.

The analysis is performed primarily using **Microsoft Excel's advanced features** to provide a comprehensive view of ER performance.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on two primary datasets:
* `Hospital Emergency Room Data.csv`: Contains raw emergency room patient records, including details like patient ID, admission date, demographics, department referrals, patient satisfaction scores, and wait times.
* `Hospital Dashboard.xlsx - Pivot Reports (Backend Work).csv`: This file likely contains summarized or aggregated data, possibly derived from the raw data, used for backend processing for a dashboard. It includes metrics such as distinct patient counts, average wait times, satisfaction scores by various categories (e.g., age group, gender).

## Features

* **Patient Demographics Analysis:** Understand the distribution of patients by age, gender, and race.
* **Wait Time Analysis:** Investigate average wait times and identify factors influencing them.
* **Patient Satisfaction Evaluation:** Analyze patient satisfaction scores to pinpoint areas needing improvement.
* **Admission Trends:** Examine patient admission flags and their correlation with other metrics.
* **Department Referral Insights:** Understand which departments refer patients to the ER most frequently.

## Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** The primary tool for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* **Power Query:** Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to clean and prepare the raw datasets.
* **Power Pivot:** Utilized for creating a robust data model, establishing relationships between tables, and defining calculated measures and KPIs.
* **Pivot Tables:** Employed to summarize, analyze, explore, and present the data from the Power Pivot data model, forming the basis of the dashboard reports.
